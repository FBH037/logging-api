- script building of database: DONE
- put timestamp on row: DONE
- Figure out why cassandra refuses to duplicate data and a way around it (possibly solved with the timestamp since it will make each row uniq?)
- dont convert from json -> javascript object -> json string... just insert JSON (cassandra supports it)
- write simple script to ping cassandra container to see if its ready for connections rather than just waiting a certain amount of time
